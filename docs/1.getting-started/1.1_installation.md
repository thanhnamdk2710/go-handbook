# How to Install Go (Golang) on Any Operating System

Go installation is straightforward across all major operating systems. This guide will walk you through the process step by step, ensuring you have a working Go development environment.

## System Requirements

Before installing Go, ensure your system meets these minimum requirements:

- Windows 10 or later (64-bit)
- macOS 12 or later (Apple or Intel 64-bit)
- Linux 3.2 or later (64-bit)
- Disk space: 2 GB for installation and dependencies
- RAM: 1GB minimum (4GB recommended)

## Installing on MacOS

### Using Homebrew (Recommended)

The simplest way to install Go on MacOS is using Homebrew:

```bash
# Update Homebrew
brew update

# Install Go
brew install go
```

### Manual Installation

#### 1. Download the latest package from the official Go website:

```
# Visit https://go.dev/dl
# Download the .pkg installer for macOS
```

#### 2. Run the installer package:

```
# Double-click the download .pkg file
# Follow the installation wizard
```

## Installing on Linux

### Ubuntu/Debian

```bash
# Update package list
sudo apt update

# Install Go
sudo apt install golang-go

# Verify installation
go version
```

### Fedora/RHEL

```bash
# Install Go
sudo dnf install golang

# Verify installation
go version
```

### Manual Installation (All Linux Distributions)

```bash
# Download the latest version
wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.22.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz

# Remove any previous Go installation
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go

# Extract the archive
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.22.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

## Installing on Windows

1. Download the Windows MSI installer from [golang.dev](https://golang.dev)
2. Run the MSI installer
3. Follow the installation wizard
4. Verify installation by opening Command Prompt:

```bash
go version
```

## Environment Setup

### Setting GOPATH and GOROOT

Add these to your shell configuration file (~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, etc.):

```bash
# GOROOT is the location where Go is installed
export GOROOT=/usr/local/go

# GOPATH is your workspace directory
export GOPATH=$HOME/go

# Add Go binary directory to PATH
export PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin:$GOPATH/bin
```

For Windows, set environment variables through System Properties:

1. Right-click on 'This PC' or 'My Computer'
2. Click 'Properties'
3. Click 'Advanced system settings'
4. Click 'Environment Variables'
5. Add or modify:
   - GOROOT: **c:\Go**
   - GOPATH: **c:\Users\YourUsername\go**
   - PATH: Add **%GOROOT%\bin**

### Verifying Installation

Run these commands to verify your installation:

```bash
# Check Go version
go version

# View Go environment information
go env

# Create and run a test program
echo 'package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Go installation successful!")
}' > test.go

go run test.go
```

## IDE Setup

For the best development experience, install one of these IDEs/editors:

### 1. Visual Studio Code

- Install VS Code
- Install Go extension
- Install Go tools:

```bash
go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest
```

### 2. Goland

- Download from Jetbrains
- No additional setup required
- Built-in Go tools

### 3. Vim/Neovim

- Install vim-go plugin
- Run :GoInstallBinaries

## Common Installation Issues

### Path Issues

```bash
# If 'go' command not found, check PATH
echo $PATH | grep go

# Verify binary location
which go
```

### Permission Issues

```bash
# Fix permission issues on Linux/macOS
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /usr/local/go
sudo chmod -R 755 /usr/local/go
```

### Proxy Settings

If behind a corporate firewall:

```bash
# Set GOPROXY
go env -w GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org,direct

# If needed, set GOPRIVATE for private repositories
go env -w GOPRIVATE=*.internal.company.com
```

## Updating Go

### On MacOS (Homebrew)

```bash
brew upgrade go
```

### On Linux

```bash
# Using package manager
sudo apt upgrade golang-go # Ubuntu/Debian
sudo dnf upgrade golang # Fedora/RHEL

# Manual update
# Download new version and repeat installation steps
```

### On Windows

- Download new MSI installer
- Run installer (automatically updates existing installation)

## Next Steps

After installation, write [your first Go program](1.2_first-program.md).
