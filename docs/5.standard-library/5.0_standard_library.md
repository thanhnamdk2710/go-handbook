# Go Standard Library Overview

The Go standard library is one of the language's greatest strengths, providing a rich set of packages that enable developers to build robust applications without external dependencies. This guide covers the most important packages and their practical applications.

## What You'll Learn

- How to perform IO operations efficiently
- Working with files and directories
- Managing time and dates
- Processing JSON data
- Using regular expressions
- Making HTTP requests
- Building HTTP servers
- Working with templates

## Core Packages Overview

### [IO Package (`io`)](5.1_io.md)

The `io` package provides basic interfaces to I/O primitives:

- `io.Reader` and `io.Writer` interfaces
- Utility functions for I/O operations
- Combining readers and writers

### [File Operations (`os`)](5.2_files.md)

The `os` package provides a platform-independent interface to operating system functionality:

- File creation and manipulation
- Directory operations
- Environment variables
- Process management

### [Time and Date (`time`)](5.3_time.md)

The `time` package provides functionality for measuring and displaying time:

- Time formatting and parsing
- Duration calculations
- Timers and tickers
- Time zones

### [JSON Processing (`encoding/json`)](5.4_json.md)

The `encoding/json` package implements encoding and decoding of JSON:

- Marshaling and unmarshaling
- Custom JSON encoders/decoders
- Working with streams

### [Regular Expressions (`regexp`)](5.5_regex.md)

The `regexp` package implements regular expression search:

- Pattern matching
- String replacement
- Regular expression compilation

### [HTTP Client (`net/http`)](5.6_http_client.md)

The HTTP client functionality:

- Making HTTP requests
- Managing cookies
- Handling redirects
- Custom transport

### HTTP Server (`net/http`)

Building HTTP servers:

- Router implementation
- Handler interface
- Middleware
- Static file serving

### Templates (`text/template` & `html/template`)

Template processing engines:

- Dynamic content generation
- HTML escaping
- Custom functions
- Nested templates

## Best Practices

1. Error Handling

- Always check for errors when performing I/O operations
- Use appropriate error wrapping
- Implement proper cleanup in defer statements

2. Resource Management

- Close files and network connections
- Use buffered I/O when appropriate
- Implement proper timeouts

3. Security

- Use `html/template` for HTML content
- Validate file paths
- Implement proper input sanitization
